Once you are logged in to the Online Workbench you are ready to start your analysis. 
The first step is to upload the images to be analysed. You then combine them into an image series corresponding to one brain using the QUINT Online app. 
File Creator also converts the images to the DZIP format required by the tools. 

.. Warning:: 
   It is recommended to work in the Google Chrome browser. This is because some of the tools do not currently work in other browsers.
