**Preparing the images for upload**
===================================

The online workbench supports upload of histological images at high-resolution and in most image formats. The main requirement is that they are named according to the QUINT file naming convention. 

**QUINT naming convention**
-------------------------------

* Add a unique ID to each image file name that reflects the serial order and spacing of the sections. 
* The format is: _sXXX with XXX representing the section number (not restricted to three digits). 

For consecutive sections: _s0001, _s0002, _s0003

For every 2nd section: _s001, _s003, _s005
