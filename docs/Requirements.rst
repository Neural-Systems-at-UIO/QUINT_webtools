**Preparing the images for upload**
===================================

The workbench supports upload of histological images at high-resolution in many image formats (TIFF, JPG, PNG). 

It is a requirement that the images are named according to the QUINT file naming convention. 

**QUINT naming convention**
-------------------------------

To ensure the images are placed in the correct order in the tools, add a unique ID to the file names reflecting the serial order and spacing of the sections. The format is: _sXXX with XXX representing the section number (not restricted to three digits). In other words, choose a starting point, either the most anterior section or most posterior section, and number all the sections relative to this. 

Example:

For consecutive sections: _s0001, _s0002, _s0003

For every 2nd horizontal section: _s001, _s003, _s005

Every 10th section starting with 3rd section: _s003, _s013, _s023, _s033, etc.
