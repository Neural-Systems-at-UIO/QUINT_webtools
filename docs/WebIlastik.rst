**WebIlastik**
================

WebIlastik is a tool for interactive image classification, segmentation and analysis using supervised machine learning. Using WebIlastik interactively train a classifier to recognise your features-of-interest, e.g. cells, receptors, or markers of pathology. You are then ready to export image segmentations to be used in the Nutil software for regional quantification.  

How to open WebIlastik?
---------------------------
In “Apps & Analysis”, click “WebIlastik” and select the relevant image series. Request a new session with the "Create" button or rejoin an existing session. 

It can take anything from seconds to minutes for a session to start. Be patient!

.. tip:: The session duration has to be specified in advance. It can take time to train a good classifier, so request at least 60 minutes in the first instance.
