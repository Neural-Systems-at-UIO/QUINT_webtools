**What is the QUINT workflow?**
===============================
   
The online QUINT workflow supports the analysis of 2D rodent brain microscopy data, allowing brain-wide mapping and regional quantification using a reference brain atlas. The workflow is used to quantify cells and establish maps of cell distribution, receptor densities, connectivity patterns or pathological protein accumulation in the brain.

.. tip::   
   An online beta version of the QUINT workflow is available at `EBRAINS Rodent Workbench <https://rodentworkbench.apps.ebrains.eu/>`_ (an EBRAINS account is required). The QUINT workflow is also available locally through the use of a series of `desktop applications <https://quint-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. The benefit of the EBRAINS Rodent Workbench is tighter integration of the tools and new functionality such as shareable microscopy viewer links and automated plotting.

Which atlases are supported?
-----------------------------

1. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (2017) (CCFv3)
2. Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat, version 3 and 4 (WHS rat brain atlas).

What is the output of the workflow?
---------------------------------

The workflow generates reports with feature counts and area fraction in reference atlas regions, and point clouds that can be used to visualise the features in 3D reference space using our Meshview Atlas Viewer.
