**What is the QUINT workflow?**
===============================
   
The QUINT workflow allows the analysis of 2D rodent brain microscopy data, answering the need for brain-wide mapping and regional quantification using a reference atlas of the brain. The workflow is used to quantify cells and establish maps of cell distribution, receptor densities, connectivity patterns or pathological protein accumulation in the brain.

.. tip::   
   The QUINT workflow is available online in the `EBRAINS Rodent Workbench <https://rodentworkbench.apps.ebrains.eu/>`_ or as a series of `downloadable desktop applications <https://quint-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

   The Rodent Workbench offers tighter integration of the tools and additional functionality such as shareable microscopy viewer links and a plotting feature.

Which atlases are supported?
-----------------------------

1. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (2017) (CCFv3)
2. Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat, version 3 and 4 (WHS rat brain atlas).

What is the output of the workflow?
---------------------------------

The workflow generates reports with object counts and area fraction in reference atlas regions, and point clouds that can be used to visualise the features in 3D reference space using our Meshview Atlas Viewer.
