**What is the QUINT workflow?**
==================

.. tip::   
   The QUINT workflow is available in the EBRAINS Collaboratory as a suite of web-based tools accessible through the Community apps. 
   
   Visit `EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/service/quint/>`_ for more information about QUINT.
   
QUINT is a workflow that supports atlas-based quantification of labelled features in series of histological images from mouse or rat brain. It generates counts and percentage coverage per atlas-region, in addition to point clouds for visualising the features in 3D. It currently supports quantification relative to the following atlases:

1. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (2015 and 2017) (CCFv3)
2. Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat, version 2, 3 and 4 (WHS rat brain atlas).
