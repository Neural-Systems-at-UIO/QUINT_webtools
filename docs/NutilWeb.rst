**WebNutil**
==============

WebNutil is used to perform quantification of segmented features in reference atlas regions, and for extracting point clouds representing the features in 3D atlas space. It combines the output from the atlas-registration step using WebAlign and WebWarp with the output of the feature extraction step using Webilastik or an external software to generate a series of reports. These can be downloaded or used interactively in the plotting Sandbox and MeshView atlas viewer.
