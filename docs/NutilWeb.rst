**NutilWeb**
==============

Nutilweb is a tool for performing brain-wide quantification of features, and for extracting point clouds for visualising the features in 3D atlas space. It combines the output from the atlas-registration step (WebAlign/WebWarp) with the output from the feature extraction step (Webilastik).
