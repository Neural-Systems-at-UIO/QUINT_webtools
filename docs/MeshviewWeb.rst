**MeshView**
=========================

 MeshView is a web application for real-time 3D display of surface mesh data representing structural parcellations from a volumetric atlas, such as the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain. Once you have completed your analysis using WebNutil, you will have the option to display a point cloud corresponding to your labelling in a relevant reference atlas. 

1. In the available results in WebNutil, click on "View in Meshview". This will open MeshView.

2. To display your points, deselect all the structures by sliding the "All" sliders to the left. Then display a transparent brain outline by moving the "root" sliders to the middle. 
3. Regions can be switched on and off by adjusting the relevant sliders.
